Anaximander the Grid Cartographer is a map tile generator for [Halcyon][]-based servers using C# utilizing parallel processing and advanced tree data structures to generate only what is needed in as short a time as possible.

For installation and building instructions, please see the [Anaximander2 wiki][wiki].

For the history buffs: [Anaximander][] was an early Greek scholar and philosopher who is credited as being one of, if not the, first to draw a map of the world.
